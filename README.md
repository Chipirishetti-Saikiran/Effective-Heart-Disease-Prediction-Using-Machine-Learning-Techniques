# Effective-Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
Heart disease is one of the most significant causes of mortality in the world today. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is a critical challenge in the area of clinical data analysis. 
Machine learning (ML) has been shown to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industry.
We have also seen ML techniques being used in recent developments in different areas of the Internet of Things (IoT). 
Various studies give only a glimpse into predicting heart disease with ML techniques. In this project, we propose a novel method that aims at finding significant features by applying machine learning techniques resulting in improving the accuracy in the prediction of cardiovascular disease. 
The prediction model is introduced with different combinations of features and several known classification techniques. We produce an enhanced performance level with an accuracy level of 88.7% through the prediction model for heart disease with the hybrid random forest with a linear model (HRFLM)
It is difficult to identify heart disease because of several con?tributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate and many other factors. 
Various techniques in data mining and neural networks have been employed to find out the severity of heart disease among humans. The severity of the disease is classified based on various methods like K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Genetic algorithm (GA), and Naive Bayes (NB). 
The nature of heart disease is complex and hence, the disease must be handled carefully. Not doing so may affect the heart or cause premature death. The per?spective of medical science and data mining are used for dis?covering various sorts of metabolic syndromes. 
Data mining with classification plays a significant role in the prediction of heart disease and data investigation. We have also seen decision trees be used in predict?ing the accuracy of events related to heart disease
Various methods have been used for knowledge abstraction by using known methods of data mining for prediction of heart disease.
